% KISS-UI

KISS-UI is a crossplatform GUI toolkit for Rust focusing on the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid!) principle. 

While it may not have as many bells and whistles as other toolkits in Rust and C, including those that actually power it, KISS-UI is intended to help its users get a GUI up and running in as few lines of code as possible.

It primarily achieves this goal by having an API that is focused on ergonomics and common-sense, as well as comprehensive, plain-English documentation. Some basic examples are also included in the repository for you to browse at your leisure, and we'll also go over some of them in this guide as well.

KISS-UI's API documentation is available online [here](https://cybergeek94.github.io/kiss-ui/docs/api/kiss_ui), or it can be generated anytime simply by running `cargo doc` in the repository folder; it can then be viewed in `target/docs/index.html`.

To render this guide from source, run the [`rustbook`](https://github.com/steveklabnik/rustbook) in the `guide/` subdirectory of the KISS-UI repository.
